Our parsing model is based on a conditional random field model, however, unlike previous TreeCRF work, e.g., (Cohn & Blunsom, 2005; Jousse et al., 2006), we do not assume a particular tree structure, and instead find the most likely structure and labeling.
Some researchers (Xue & Palmer, 2004; Koomen et al., 2005; Cohn & Blunsom, 2005; Punyakanok et al., 2008; Toutanova et al., 2005, 2008) used a pipelined approach to attack the task.
They have been used for tree labelling, in XML tree labelling (Jousse et al., 2006) and semantic role labelling tasks (Cohn & Blunsom, 2005).
Finally, probabilistic models have also been applied to produce the structured output, for example, generative models (Thompson, Levy, & Manning, 2003), sequence tagging with classifiers (M`rquez et al., 2005; Pradhan et al., a  2005), and Conditional Random Fields on tree structures (Cohn & Blunsom 2005).
As for SRL on news, most researchers used the pipelined approach, i.e., dividing the task into several phases such as argument identification, argument classification, global inference, etc., and conquering them individually (Xue & Palmer, 2004; Koomen et al., 2005; Cohn & Blunsom, 2005; Punyakanok et al., 2008; Toutanova et al., 2005, 2008).
Although T-CRFs are relatively new models, they have already been applied toseveral NLP tasks, such as semantic role labeling, semantic annotation, word sense disambiguation, image modeling (Cohn & Blunsom, 2005; Tang et al., 2006; Jun et al., 2009; Awasthi et al., 2007).
The model can be used for tasks like syntactic parsing (Finkel et al., 2008) and semantic role labeling (Cohn & Blunsom, 2005).
Regarding novel learning paradigms not applied in previous shared tasks, we find Relevant Vector Machine (RVM), which is a kernel-based linear discriminant inside the framework of Sparse Bayesian Learning (Johansson & Nugues, 2005) and Tree Conditional Random Fields (T-CRF) (Cohn & Blunsom, 2005), that extend the sequential CRF model to tree structures.
We use CRFs as our models for both tasks (Cohn & Blunsom, 2005).
