GIST: Text Summarizer based on ranking of sentences in document
• Implemented a tool that summarizes free form text file or pdf or a web page.
• It is an implementation of two research papers: Generating Extractive Summaries, LexRank: Graph based Lexical Centrality for Text Summarization.
• The tool considers each sentence as node and computes similarity among nodes and builds a graph then detects communities in the network, in the final
phase it selects important nodes in each community using Lex Rank method.
